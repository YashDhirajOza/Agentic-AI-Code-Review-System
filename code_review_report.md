## 🔴 Critical Security Issues

### 1. D:\code_review\pig_repo\app.py:21
**Source:** Manual
**Issue:** Security pattern detected: eval_usage
**Code:** `def run_eval(expression):...`

### 2. D:\code_review\pig_repo\app.py:22
**Source:** Manual
**Issue:** Security pattern detected: eval_usage
**Code:** `return eval(expression)...`

### 3. D:\code_review\pig_repo\app.py:27
**Source:** Manual
**Issue:** Security pattern detected: pickle_loads
**Code:** `return pickle.loads(data)...`

### 4. D:\code_review\pig_repo\server.py:16
**Source:** Manual
**Issue:** Security pattern detected: eval_usage
**Code:** `result = run_unvalidated_eval(expr)...`

### 5. D:\code_review\pig_repo\app.py:9
**Source:** Gemini
**Issue:** [Gemini] Hardcoded username makes brute-forcing easier if other security measures are weak.  The application should use a more robust authentication mechanism, such as a database of users and strong password hashing.
**Fix:** Remove hardcoded username and password. Implement proper user authentication and authorization using a database and secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).

### 6. D:\code_review\pig_repo\app.py:14
**Source:** Gemini
**Issue:** [Gemini] SQL injection vulnerability.  The query directly incorporates the username without sanitization, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
**Fix:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.  Never directly embed user input into SQL queries.

### 7. D:\code_review\pig_repo\app.py:28
**Source:** Gemini
**Issue:** [Gemini] Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application directly echoes user-supplied input ('name') in the HTML response without sanitization, making it susceptible to XSS attacks.
**Fix:** Sanitize the 'name' variable before embedding it in the HTML response. Use an escaping function to convert special characters to their HTML entities (e.g., Flask's `escape()` function or similar).

### 8. D:\code_review\pig_repo\app.py:23
**Source:** Gemini
**Issue:** [Gemini] Using pickle.loads() to deserialize data from an untrusted source is extremely dangerous.  This can lead to arbitrary code execution via malicious data.
**Fix:** Avoid using pickle for deserialization of untrusted data.  Use a safer serialization method like JSON.

### 9. D:\code_review\pig_repo\server.py:25
**Source:** Gemini
**Issue:** [Gemini] The `/deserialize` endpoint uses `load_user_data` to deserialize data received from a POST request.  Without knowing the format and source of this data, this is highly vulnerable to deserialization attacks.  An attacker could craft malicious data to execute arbitrary code on the server.
**Fix:** Implement strict input validation and data sanitization before deserialization.  Validate the data's format and structure against a predefined schema.  Consider using a safer deserialization library that supports secure deserialization or employ a whitelist approach allowing only trusted data formats.
